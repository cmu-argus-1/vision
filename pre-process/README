## Data Selection for different conditions, e.g. cloud coverage & time

1. **Random Selection**: Start by randomly picking a subset of images from your dataset.

2. **Stratify by Cloud Cover**: Divide the selected images into groups based on cloud cover percentages (e.g., 0-10%, 11-20%).

3. **Proportional Sampling**: Within each cloud cover group, sample images proportionally to match the original cloud cover distribution.

4. **Verification & Testing**: Start with the proposed selection of the dataset, use validation data to update the selection
